<h2> My favourite person is Roald Dahl.></h2>

    <h5> Roald Dahl was born in 13 September 1916 Llandaff, Cardiff, Wales.</h5>
<p> He was novelist, poet, screenwriter.
    He has studied in the Cathedral School, Llandaff
    One time,his father was a wealthy shipbroker who left behind a fortune of £150,000 (about £4.5 million in 2016) when he died in 1920.
    After school
    After finishing his schooling, in August 1934 Dahl crossed the Atlantic on the RMS Nova Scotia and hiked through Newfoundland with the Public Schools Exploring Society.

    In July 1934, Dahl joined the Shell Petroleum Company. Following two years of training in the United Kingdom, he was assigned first to Mombasa, Kenya, then to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanganyika (now part of Tanzania). Along with the only two other Shell employees in the entire territory, he lived in luxury in the Shell House outside Dar es Salaam, with a cook and personal servants. While out on assignments supplying oil to customers across Tanganyika, he encountered black mamba snakes and lions, among other wildlife.
